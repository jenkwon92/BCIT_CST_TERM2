Write SQL Script to add Foreign Key to ITEM table on SupplierCode  REFERENCES SUPPLIER(SupplierCode)

In order to add the FK, you need to first fix the data/schema. 
Write all the SQL's in order to create the foreign key.

Hint: Use ALTER table syntax to create FK. Pay attention to the SQL error and proceed as per the error message to fix the problem.

1. Column 'SUPPLIER.SupplierCode' is not the same length or scale as referencing column 'ITEM.SupplierCode' in foreign key 'FK_ITEM_SUPPLIER'. Columns participating in a foreign key relationship must be defined with the same length and scale.
To match the length as referencing column, change the length.

ALTER TABLE ITEM
ALTER COLUMN SupplierCode char(3);   

2. The ALTER TABLE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_ITEM_SUPPLIER". The conflict occurred in database "YKCOMP1630ASSIGMENT3", table "dbo.SUPPLIER", column 'SupplierCode'. 
Because of the SupplierCode "S03", this conflict occured. To solve this, delete the SupplierCode which is not existing in the SUPPLIER table.

DELETE FROM ITEM
WHERE SupplierCode NOT IN (SELECT SupplierCode FROM SUPPLIER);

3. After finishing the fix the data/schema, we can add the FK.
ALTER TABLE ITEM
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_ITEM_SUPPLIER
FOREIGN KEY (SupplierCode)
REFERENCES SUPPLIER(SupplierCode);

ALTER TABLE ITEM
ALTER COLUMN SupplierCode char(3);  

DELETE FROM ITEM
WHERE SupplierCode NOT IN (SELECT SupplierCode FROM SUPPLIER);

ALTER TABLE ITEM

FOREIGN KEY (SupplierCode)
REFERENCES SUPPLIER(SupplierCode);
